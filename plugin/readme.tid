!!!How does this plugin work?

When you edit and save a tiddler, this plugin automatically attatches a field named 'lower-title' with lower-cased title as its value.
The plugin also maintains an [[indexer|$:/plugins/bluegreen/case-insensitive/LowerTitleIndexer.js]] to speed up the search.
It also overrides the builtin link widget with custom [[LowerLinkWidget|$:/plugins/bluegreen/case-insensitive/LowerLinkWidget.js]] to search for lower-title field using the indexer.
Because the plugin isn't iterating over all tiddlers, but instead finds the title from the hashmap using the indexer, links don't decrease performance significantly.
The indexer is built when you launch tiddlywiki, and is updated when you modify a tiddler.
