!!!How does this plugin work?

The plugin maintains a [[LowerTitleIndexer|$:/plugins/bluegreen/case-insensitive/LowerTitleIndexer.js]] of {title.toLowerCase(): title}.
It also overrides the builtin link widget with custom [[LowerLinkWidget|$:/plugins/bluegreen/case-insensitive/LowerLinkWidget.js]] to search for proper case title using LowerTitleIndexer.
When searching for links, because the plugin finds the title from the hashmap instead of iterating over all tiddlers, links don't decrease performance significantly.
The indexer is built every time you launch tiddlywiki, and is updated when you modify a tiddler. So it //may// take slightly more time for the Tiddlywiki to launch.
